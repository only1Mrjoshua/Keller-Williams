Beyond the wrought-iron entry doors and private courtyard, you'll experience a dramatically scaled yet wonderfully comfortable great room upon entry. Soaring ceilings, open sightlines, and broad transitions between gathering spaces create an immediate sense of openness and ease, while warm materials and soft natural light infuse the room with calm, welcoming energy. At the heart of the residence, a magazine-worthy chef's kitchen dazzles with a grand center island, rich custom cabinetry, and countertops and full-height backsplash showcasing dramatic, richly veined natural stone with deep earth tones that add depth and visual texture. A striking row of transom-topped casement windows fills the room with soft, ambient light. The kitchen is appointed with a professional-grade Wolf range, warming drawer, full-size built-in refrigerator and freezer columns, dual-zone wine fridge, and a generous walk-in butler's pantry. A convenient pass-through window provides effortless service to the outdoor dining area. The primary suite is privately situated at the end of a long corridor lined with French doors and offers a peaceful sanctuary with serene views and direct outdoor access. A custom-tiled fireplace anchors the sitting area, creating an inviting spot to relax and unwind. The spa-inspired bath features a jetted soaking tub with tranquil views, a frameless walk-in shower and built-in bench, and a custom vanity with abundant storage and dedicated seating. A spacious, fully customized walk-in closet completes the suite. French doors throughout the home open to a sweeping covered veranda thoughtfully designed with multiple zones for open-air dining, relaxed lounging, and effortless entertaining while overlooking the lush, private backyard retreat. Equestrian amenities include a 1,400 sq ft, 5-stall barn with tack room and bathroom, plus direct trail access to Griffith Park and easy proximity to public riding arenas, top-rated schools, the Americana, and major studios.",
